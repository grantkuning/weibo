Weibo Scraper
=====
This is a program designed to track censorship on the dominant Chinese microblogging
platform, Weibo, using Selenium. The current version simply logs in to my Weibo account
and scrapes my feed for posts and images, saving them into folders in a designated
directory sorted by user and time. In the future, I intend to smoothen out the code
a little bit and add a function to periodically check that the posts saved to my
computer are still online--that is, that they have not been deleted. For now, this is
done semi-manually using wbcheck.py.
